      <h2>About Me </h2>
      <p>I'm an engineer turned passionate UI/UX designer who loves solving complex problems and creating user-friendly experiences. 
        My unique perspective combines technical knowledge with creative design thinking. I believe great design is about empathy and understanding the userâ€™s journey, not just aesthetics.
        I stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the UI/UX field.
        When not designing, I explore new technologies and seek inspiration from various art forms.</p>
